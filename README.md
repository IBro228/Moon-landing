# Moon-landing

Meeting of the spacecraft with the Moon, if not accepted
special measures will lead to its destruction on the surface of the moon itself.

With this program, you can clearly see how different
parameters affect the landing of the device on the lunar surface.

This project uses the formulas of Meshchersky and Tsialkovsky
to calculate the acceleration of the rocket.
